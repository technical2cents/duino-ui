DUINO-UI Project
=============
This project provides a base development platform for building a UI for PC duino based projects.

The current implementation caters for displaying pin info and switching pins on and off via visual switches on a web based UI. (You can also expose this via your router at home if you want to get this accessed remotely, seems to work just fine)

The project makes use of a couple of technologies as follow:

* Python 2.7
* Flask (Rest based framework built on python)
* SQL lite for DB (Added for future use)
* Angular For frontend Single page app Client 
* Jquery 
* Bootstrap CSS
* GPIO python lib for access to PC-Duino pins
